Project Title:

"ShareSphere – Connect. Contribute. Care."

People often have usable items (like furniture, clothes, books) or surplus food (especially after events) that they no longer need.
At the same time, many individuals or NGOs are looking for these resources but lack a way to find or connect with donors nearby.
So, this is the way to connect with needy.
